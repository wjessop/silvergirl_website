      <description>&lt;p&gt;I needed to go up the mast for a couple of reasons, firstly I&amp;rsquo;d not done a rig check since we bought the boat (there were just too many things on the TODO list that took prefefence) and I wanted to make sure that everything was as it should be, but also because the active radar target enhancer had blown off and was sitting at the bottom of the Bay of Biscay somewhere and I wanted to check to see what the state of the remaining bracket was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was up there I took a photo looking down at the deck. It&amp;rsquo;s not a view you get to see of your boat very often and it&amp;rsquo;s nice to get a different perspective. I was pretty worried about dropping my phone though, next time I&amp;rsquo;ll take the GoPro tied to something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;full&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;images/View%20from%20the%20top%20of%20the%20mast.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/View%20from%20the%20top%20of%20the%20mast.jpg&#34;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also took a photo looking back across the Ll≈∑n Peninsula while I was up there, I believe one of the lumps in the background is &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowdon&#34;&gt;Snowdon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;full&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;images/Snowdon%20from%20the%20top%20of%20the%20mast.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/Snowdon%20from%20the%20top%20of%20the%20mast.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;View of Snowden from the top of Silver Girl&amp;#39;s mast&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;View of Snowden from the top of Silver Girl&amp;rsquo;s mast, click for full size.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
