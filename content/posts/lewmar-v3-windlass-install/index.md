Notes:

- Motor means there isn't much more space in the chain locker, and it will need protecting too, either the gearbox or the motor attachment screw is really close to the dropping chain.
- Not worked out where to attach the bitter end yet
- Not worked out where to attach the snubber yet
- Made the cables long enough to be able to remove the motor, but should just have made the hole through the bulkhead bigger to allow unfastened cables through.
- Should have made the holes in the bulkhead closer to the middle of the bulkhead for better cable management
- Ran the cables to the motor the wrong way, will need to change that.
